# Wallace Tree Multiplier


This repository contains the implementation of a Wallace Tree Multiplier, a commonly used multiplier architecture in computer architecture. The Wallace Tree Multiplier is designed to perform fast multiplication of binary numbers using a combination of partial products and carry-save addition.

## Contents

>> verilog/: Verilog source code for the Wallace Tree Multiplier implementation.

>> presentation/: PowerPoint presentation slides providing an overview of the Wallace Tree Multiplier and its implementation.

>> logisim/: Logisim circuit file showcasing the Wallace Tree Multiplier circuit.


## Usage

1) Clone the repository to your local machine:
== git clone https://github.com/your-username/wallace-tree-multiplier.git

2) Verilog Implementation:

== Use a Verilog simulator or synthesis tool to analyze and simulate the verilog/wallace_tree_multiplier.v file. This file contains the Verilog code for the Wallace Tree Multiplier.

3) Presentation:

==  Open the presentation/WallaceTreeMultiplier.pptx file to view the PowerPoint presentation explaining the concept and implementation of the Wallace Tree Multiplier.

== Feel free to modify the presentation slides to suit your needs.

4) logisim 

== Open the logisim/WallaceTreeMultiplier.circ file using Logisim, a digital logic simulator.

== Explore the circuit, simulate inputs, and observe the outputs of the Wallace Tree Multiplier.
